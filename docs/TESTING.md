# Frontend testing — Ofisi

Two complementary layers cover the React app. Both are hermetic (no Go backend,
no relay): the API surface is mocked.

## Running

### Layer 1 — Vitest (runs now, no setup)

```bash
npm test                      # whole suite
npx vitest run src/__tests__/msw/           # just the MSW integration tests
npx vitest                    # watch mode
```

The MSW integration tests live in `src/__tests__/msw/`:

| File | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `versionHistory.integration.test.jsx` | snapshot list + restore; **wave-14** role gate (viewer/commenter refused, owner/editor allowed) |
| `comments.integration.test.jsx` | add / resolve / reopen / reply, tab filters |
| `suggestions.integration.test.jsx` | create / accept / reject, state PUT round-trip |
| `docsEditor.integration.test.jsx` | **real TipTap** — typing order (no "olleh"), **wave-19** font size/family, bold/heading/list/link, export menu (DOCX/PDF/MD) |
| `p2pShare.integration.test.jsx` | **wave-25** share modal, invite parse → room, ro rejection, E2E crypto seal, two-session convergence |
| `slidesEditor.integration.test.jsx` | **full SlidesEditor mount** — open, add slide, reorder, presenter toggle, presence pill |
| `sheetsEditor.integration.test.jsx` | cell-edit round-trip via SheetsFindReplace, presence pill derivation |

**How the mock works.** `src/__tests__/msw/handlers.js` is a small, *stateful*
in-memory backend (files, versions, comments, suggestions). `resetMock({ role })`
reseeds it per test; the `role` flips the server-side restore gate. Requests flow
through the *real* `src/lib/api.js` client → `fetch` → MSW. The CRDT stores
(`getCommentStore`, `getSuggestionStore`) are module singletons, so the tests
`evict*Store()` in `beforeEach` to avoid cross-test leakage.

### Layer 2 — Playwright (one-time browser install)

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium   # once
npm run test:e2e                              # builds vite, serves preview, runs
npm run test:e2e:ui                           # interactive UI mode
```

`pretest:e2e` runs `vite build` first; `playwright.config.js` then serves the
build with `vite preview` on port **47317** (an uncommon port, and
`reuseExistingServer: false`, so a stale preview of another Vulos app on a shared
port can never be tested by mistake). Service workers are blocked so a cached PWA
shell can't shadow the mocks.

**How the mock works.** `e2e/fixtures.js` installs a `page.route('**/api/**')`
handler mirroring the MSW backend (auth, files, versions with the wave-14 gate,
comments, suggestions). The `officePage` fixture attaches it automatically;
`installBackend(page, { role })` lets a test choose the role for the restore gate.

### Layer 3 — Real P2P integration (`npm run test:e2e:p2p`)

The one suite in this repo with **no mocks at all**. It exists because the
repo's central architectural claim — *a standalone Ofisi, with no Vulos OS and
no account, does real peer-to-peer collaboration through any self-hosted
`vulos-relayd`* — was otherwise covered only by selector unit tests with a fake
fabric.

```bash
npm run test:e2e:p2p
```

What it boots (`e2e-p2p/stack.mjs`): a real `vulos-relayd` built from the
sibling `../vulos-relay` checkout with `-rendezvous`, and **two** standalone
`vulos-office` servers on separate ports with separate data dirs, both pointed
at that relayd — plus a third with no rendezvous configured for the negative
case. The two peers therefore share **no** server: only the relayd, and the room
key in the invite link's URL fragment.

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Go toolchain | builds the Ofisi binary and (unless `VULOS_RELAYD_BIN` is set) `vulos-relayd` |
| `../vulos-relay` checkout | override with `VULOS_RELAY_REPO`; the suite **never modifies** it, it only `go build`s to a temp path. The whole file skips with a clear message when it is absent. |
| `VULOS_RELAYD_BIN` | optional prebuilt relayd — what CI uses, so a broken relay checkout is reported as such and never mistaken for a failed claim |
| Chromium flags | `playwright.p2p.config.js` sets `--disable-features=WebRtcHideLocalIpsWithMdns` so two loopback contexts can actually see each other's host candidates. This affects candidate visibility only — no protocol, signaling path or crypto changes. |

What it asserts: the relay is reachable **and** cross-origin usable by a
browser — `Allow-Origin: *`, a preflight that succeeds, no `Allow-Credentials`,
verified both by header inspection and by fetching the relay from a real
Chromium page on an Ofisi origin, since only a browser enforces CORS. That is
the guarantee the direct-to-relay transport rests on, so a relayd that regressed
it fails here rather than in the field. (Ofisi used to carry a same-origin proxy
because the relay served no CORS; that is gone, and the suite asserts Ofisi
mounts nothing for discovery.) It also asserts: a standalone Ofisi serves no
`/api/peering/*`; two browsers converge in both directions with the relay's own
presence state confirming the signaling went through it — with the browsers'
request logs showing the rendezvous calls aimed at the **relay's** origin, not
either Ofisi's; offline divergence
merges as a union on reconnect; and — the negative control — an unconfigured
deployment reports local-only and refuses to mint invite links. The transport
that carried the edits is asserted as *either* a direct host/host WebRTC pair
*or* the content-blind relay circuit, and the run logs which, rather than
pretending "direct" in a sandbox where ICE cannot complete.

### The mocked E2E specs (layer 2):

| File | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `docs.e2e.js` | open doc, typing order, bold, **wave-19 font size**, outline, find, word count, export menu |
| `collab.e2e.js` | version restore (owner ✓ / **wave-14** viewer ✗ 403), comments add + resolve |
| `p2p.e2e.js` | **wave-25** share modal generates rw+ro links; ro fragment survives navigation |
| `sheets-slides.e2e.js` | Sheets: open + cell type + presence; Slides: open + add slide + presenter + presence |

## Coverage boundaries (what's tested where, and why)

- **Sheets grid interaction** (click a cell, formula bar) is Playwright-only:
  `@fortune-sheet` needs a real `<canvas>` and hangs under jsdom. The cell/model
  logic is unit-tested in vitest.
- **P2P convergence / read-only *enforcement* / crypto seal** is proven headless
  with an injected in-process fabric (`src/lib/crdt/__tests__/p2pSession.test.js`
  and `p2pShare.integration.test.jsx`). The browser E2E covers the *sharer UI* and
  invite-link format; full ro enforcement in the browser would need a live relay.
