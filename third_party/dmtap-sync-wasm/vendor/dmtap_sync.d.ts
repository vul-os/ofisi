 * It would be one line, and it would be wrong. WASM linear memory is an ordinary

 * reliable zeroization exist in that address space. Handing a raw Ed25519 seed across this
 * boundary would therefore downgrade a `CryptoKey` the browser *guarantees* is non-extractable
 * into bytes sitting in a readable buffer for the lifetime of the tab. That is a real loss of a
 * real protection, bought for the price of one `crypto.subtle.sign` call.
 *
 * The detached protocol costs one extra hop through JS and preserves the property that matters:
 * the signing key can live in WebCrypto with `extractable: false`, in a hardware token, or behind
 * a remote signing service, and this crate never learns it. Verification needs only public keys,
 * so the ingest path is unaffected.
 *
 * The insecure path is not "discouraged" here — it is **absent**, because a documented-but-present
 * footgun is still a footgun. `dmtap_sync::cose::sign_op` remains available to native Rust
 * callers, who have a memory model in which holding a secret key is a defensible thing to do.
