/**
 * dmtap-sync-wasm — loader for the vendored DMTAP Sync substrate binding.
 *
 * The upstream `pkg/` is a wasm-pack **bundler**-target package whose entry
 * (`dmtap_sync.js`) does `import * as wasm from './dmtap_sync_bg.wasm'`. That is
 * an ESM-imports-WASM statement, which needs a bundler plugin in Vite and does
 * not work at all under Vitest/node. Rather than add a plugin (and a second,
 * divergent path for tests), this loader instantiates the module itself.
 *
 * That is safe and lossless, because the wasm-pack glue is deliberately split:
 *   • `dmtap_sync_bg.js` — ALL the JS-side wrappers and the host functions the
 *     module imports. Target-independent. Exports `__wbg_set_wasm(exports)`.
 *   • `dmtap_sync_bg.wasm` — the compiled core. It declares exactly ONE import
 *     module, `'./dmtap_sync_bg.js'` (3 imports total).
 *   • `dmtap_sync.js` — 8 lines of target-specific wiring: instantiate, call
 *     `__wbg_set_wasm`, call `__wbindgen_start`, re-export.
 *
 * Only the last file is target-specific, and this module is a faithful,
 * environment-agnostic replacement for it. The `.wasm` and the wrappers are the
 * upstream artifacts BYTE-FOR-BYTE — there is no re-implementation here, which
 * is the whole point of adopting a shared engine.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   import { loadSync } from 'dmtap-sync-wasm'
 *   const sync = await loadSync()          // idempotent; one instance per process
 *   const engine = new sync.SyncEngine()
 *
 * Every call on the returned namespace is SYNCHRONOUS (the upstream README's
 * contract); only this one-time load is async.

 * Read the vendored `.wasm` as bytes.
 *
 * The two environments need genuinely different resolution, and the branch is
 * on the ENVIRONMENT rather than on the resulting URL's scheme — because the
 * URL is not the same expression in both.
 *
 * • Browser. `new URL('…', import.meta.url)` written as a static literal is the
 *   form Vite recognises: it emits `vendor/dmtap_sync_bg.wasm` as a build asset
 *   and rewrites the expression to that asset's hashed URL. The module is
 *   therefore FETCHED at runtime and never inlined into the JS bundle — the
 *   ~387 KB does not land in any chunk and is not downloaded at all unless this
 *   loader runs.
 *
 * • Node / Vitest. That same rewritten expression resolves against the dev
 *   server (an `http://localhost:…` URL), so evaluating it under Vitest would
 *   try to fetch the wasm over a socket that is not listening. Resolve off disk
 *   instead, via `createRequire` against this module's real path — which is why
 *   the Node branch must not touch the `new URL` literal at all.
