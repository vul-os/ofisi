// auth_me_test.go — the shells' auth boundary must actually EXIST.

// RequireAuth.jsx has always called GET /api/auth/me and redirected to the CP
// login on 401. But the route was never registered: the call 404'd, which is not
// a 401, so the shell concluded "authed" and the client-side boundary silently
// never fired. Server-side enforcement (AuthWithSSO) still held, so this was a UX
// bug rather than an authz hole — the user got a broken app instead of a login
// redirect. These tests pin the route's existence and its two verdicts.
