/**
 * src/apps/docs/collabExtension.js — the TipTap ↔ Yjs bridge.
 *
 * ySyncPlugin keeps the ProseMirror document and the Y.XmlFragment in lock-step:
 * a local transaction is written into the Y.Doc, and a remote Yjs update is
 * turned back into a ProseMirror TRANSACTION with correctly mapped positions.
 * That mapping is the entire point of this change — the old transport applied a
 * remote edit at a plain-text character offset, which does not address a position
 * in a structured document at all.
 *
 * UNDO must come from Yjs too (yUndoPlugin). ProseMirror's own history is
 * disabled when collaboration is on (see DocsEditor's StarterKit config), because
 * a shared-document undo has to be USER-SCOPED: plain history would let Ctrl+Z
 * revert a REMOTE peer's change (which then re-broadcasts as a local delete and
 * corrupts the shared document). The Yjs UndoManager only ever undoes the local
 * user's own changes.
 *
 * Because StarterKit's history is off, `editor.commands.undo()` / `.redo()` would
 * otherwise vanish from the command API — and other features call them (e.g.
 * suggestion mode reverts the local edit before recording it as a proposal). We
 * re-provide both commands, backed by the Yjs undo manager, so the editor's
 * public command surface is unchanged.
