/**
 * src/apps/sheets/odsChartsRead.js
 *
 * DETECT charts + pivot tables in an imported .ods (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) so
 * their loss is HONEST, never silent.
 *
 * THE DATA LOSS THIS CLOSES. SheetJS reads .ods CELLS but exposes nothing about
 * an .ods chart or DataPilot (pivot) — and, unlike the .xlsx path, Vulos has no
 * reader that turns an .ods chart into a live Vulos chart. So opening a
 * chart-bearing .ods gave a workbook with the cells and NO charts, and
 * re-exporting it wrote a file with no charts either: the exact silent
 * round-trip data loss the .xlsx path already fixed with importNotes. This module
 * is the .ods half — it does NOT try to import the charts (it cannot), it COUNTS
 * them so importWorkbook can record the loss and the export dialog can restate it.
 *
 * HOW (a real, observable signal). An .ods is a ZIP (JSZip is already a
 * dependency). Two canonical signals, both defined by the OpenDocument spec:
 *   - CHARTS: every embedded chart object is a directory file-entry in
 *     META-INF/manifest.xml with media-type
 *     "application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.chart". Counting those entries counts
 *     the charts (the per-object content.xml/preview entries carry other
 *     media-types, so they are not double-counted).
 *   - PIVOTS: a DataPilot table is a <table:data-pilot-table> element in
 *     content.xml. Counting those counts the pivots.
 *
 * SECURITY. The file is untrusted. The whole package is already size-gated by
 * assertFileSize before this runs (see workbookToSheets). We additionally skip a
 * part whose declared uncompressed size is implausibly large (a zip-bomb belt),
 * count with a bounded scan, and clamp the reported counts. Nothing here is
 * eval'd, nothing builds HTML, no external entity is expanded (we string-match a
 * couple of well-known markers rather than DOM-parsing arbitrary XML).
