/**
 * sheetsDeepLink.test.jsx — opening a spreadsheet by URL (deep link / refresh)
 * must actually render the document's cells.
 *
 * FortuneSheet's <Workbook> is UNCONTROLLED: it reads `data` at MOUNT and ignores
 * later changes to the prop. When a sheet is opened directly (a bookmark, a hard
 * refresh, the screenshotter), the file is not yet in the store, so the editor
 * mounts on the empty fallback sheet and only afterwards does api.getFile resolve.
 * The resulting setData was silently dropped by the grid, and the user saw an
 * EMPTY spreadsheet — as though their data were gone.
 *
 * The mock below reproduces exactly that semantics (it records the data it was
 * given at mount, and ignores prop updates), so this test fails against the old
 * code and passes only when a wholesale load remounts the grid.
