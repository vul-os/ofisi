 *
 * ── VITE_DOCS_COLLAB — live co-editing in Docs ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Docs' live collaboration (server relay + P2P invite links) is gated behind
 * this flag so a deployment can turn co-editing OFF and keep a perfectly good
 * single-user editor. It exists because collaborative sync is the one feature
 * whose failure mode is SILENT DATA CORRUPTION rather than a visible error:
 * a sync path that mis-maps a remote change onto the local document can move
 * content into the wrong node (inside a table cell, across a block boundary)
 * and the user has no way to know. When the flag is off, Docs never opens a
 * sync transport at all — no ops in, no ops out — and the UI says so plainly
 * instead of showing collaboration affordances that quietly do nothing.
 *
 * HONESTY CONTRACT (the reason this flag is not just an if-statement):
 *   • Off  → every co-editing affordance is hidden or explicitly labelled
 *            unavailable. A user must never believe their edits are syncing
 *            when they are not. See DocsEditor's "Live co-editing off" pill,
 *            the AccountShareModal notice, and the invite-link toast.
 *   • On   → co-editing runs the structure-aware (Yjs / y-prosemirror) path,
 *            which propagates formatting + structure and can never place a
 *            remote change at a wrong offset.
 *
 * Values: "on" | "1" | "true" enable; "off" | "0" | "false" disable.
 *
 * DEFAULT: ON. The sync path is now structure-aware (Yjs + y-prosemirror — see
 * lib/crdt/ydoc.js): remote changes arrive as ProseMirror transactions with
 * correctly mapped positions, so formatting and structure propagate and a remote
 * change can never be applied at a wrong offset. The flag remains as an operator
 * kill-switch — set VITE_DOCS_COLLAB=off to ship Docs as a single-user editor,
 * and the UI will say so plainly rather than degrade silently.
 *
 * (It defaulted OFF for exactly one commit: the transport before this one diffed
 * the document as PLAIN TEXT, which could not carry formatting at all and whose
 * character offsets did not address positions in a structured document — a remote
 * insert could land inside the wrong node and corrupt it.)

/**
 * True when Sheets should run its grid CRDT on the SHARED DMTAP Sync substrate
 * engine (`dmtap-sync-wasm`, an LWW register per §4.4 of substrate/SYNC.md)
 * instead of the hand-rolled LWW map in src/lib/crdt/grid.js.
 *
 * Off by default, and additive exactly as VITE_UPDATE_LOG was: with the flag
 * off, not one byte of the substrate is loaded or executed and Sheets behaves
 * precisely as before. Turn on with VITE_SUBSTRATE_SYNC=on at build time.
 *
 * WHY A FLAG AND NOT A CUTOVER. The two engines are each internally convergent
 * but they do not share a TOTAL ORDER: grid.js resolves a conflicting write by
 * (lamport counter, replicaId) and ignores wall-clock time, while the substrate
 * resolves by a full HLC (wall, counter, author) per §3. For two concurrent
 * writes to the same cell they can therefore pick different winners. Every
 * replica in a deployment must run the SAME path, which a build-time flag
 * guarantees and a gradual rollout would not.
 *
 * The substrate engine is WASM and loads asynchronously, so the Sheets editor
 * awaits initSubstrateSync() before opening a session. If that load fails, the
 * editor falls back to the grid.js path rather than leaving the user with a
 * grid that silently records nothing.
 *
 * See src/lib/crdt/substrateGrid.js and third_party/dmtap-sync-wasm/VENDOR.md.
