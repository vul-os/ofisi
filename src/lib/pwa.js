/**
 * src/lib/pwa.js — PWA glue for the standalone Office shell.
 *
 * Two responsibilities, both progressive enhancements that degrade to no-ops:
 *
 *   1. isEmbedded() — is Office running inside another frame (e.g. embedded as
 *      an iframe in the OS hub at app.vulos.org)? Office always runs on its OWN
 *      origin, so its service worker never collides with the OS shell's worker
 *      on another origin; but when Office is a nested embed we still do NOT
 *      register — the OS shell owns the install/offline experience for that
 *      surface, and a nested SW/install prompt there would be noise. Opened
 *      top-level (office.vulos.org standalone, its own subdomain, or an
 *      installed PWA) we DO register.
 *
 *   2. registerServiceWorker() — boots the offline-first app shell in
 *      production, top-level only. It delegates to the first-party offline
 *      bootstrap (src/lib/endpoints/offlineBootstrap.js), which (a) registers
 *      public/sw.js for app-shell caching,
 *      (b) primes the cloud↔LAN endpoint failover so the first API call already
 *      has a reachable endpoint chosen, and (c) wires SW update detection.
 *      No-op in dev, when embedded, or on unsupported browsers. Failures are
 *      swallowed: offline boot is an enhancement, never a hard dependency.
 *
 * NOTE: Office is a document product. The service worker (public/sw.js) is
 * deliberately conservative — it never caches /api, /v1, auth, collab, or any
 * path carrying document bytes. See src/sw.security.test.js for the contract.
