/**
 * substrateTree.mapping.test.js — the Slides half of the substrate-adoption
 * investigation, recorded as EVIDENCE rather than as a claim.
 *
 * Sheets' grid was adopted onto the shared engine (see substrateGrid.js and its
 * convergence suite). Slides was the other candidate: `crdt/tree.js` is a
 * fractional-index ordered tree, and SYNC.md §4.8 specifies a movable tree.
 * This file establishes, by execution, exactly HOW MUCH of Slides the substrate
 * reproduces — so the decision not to swap the editor in this change is founded
 * on a measured boundary rather than on caution.
 *
 * VERDICT (what these tests show)
 * ------------------------------
 * The structural half maps CLEANLY and is proven here:
 *   • Ofisi's slide order is a flat list under one root, addressed by the same
 *     fractional `ordKey` strings — `tree-move`'s `(parent, ordering_key)` LWW
 *     register is precisely that, with the ordKeys carried unchanged.
 *   • Reordering a slide is a second `tree-move`; greater HLC wins (§4.8/§4.4).
 *   • Deleting a slide is PERMANENT in tree.js (`n.deleted = true`, with no
 *     path that revives it), which is exactly the remove-wins death certificate
 *     of §4.5 — a better fit than Sheets' clear, which had to avoid it.
 *   • Concurrent moves converge to one identical tree regardless of delivery
 *     order.
 *
 * The CONTENT half does not map as directly, and this is the real finding:
 *   • A slide's content is object-granular (`SlideState`: per-object LWW,
 *     per-object tombstone, per-scalar LWW). Each of those IS an LWW register,
 *     so the algebra covers it — but a slide object is a NESTED JSON object,
 *     and §4.1 restricts a value to the `ext-value` subset (no nested maps). It
 *     must therefore cross as a JSON `tstr`, which works and is asserted below,
 *     at the cost of the substrate no longer seeing inside the value.
 *   • Per-object DELETION would need the same tagged-tombstone trick Sheets
 *     uses for `clearCell`, since a death certificate is per-OBJECT (a whole
 *     slide) and not per-FIELD (one shape on a slide).
 *
 * So Slides is expressible, and the remaining work is a faithful port of
 * tree.js's 849 lines — including its legacy SET_TEXT back-compat path and its
 * snapshot rehydration, which synthesises INSERT/MOVE ops to restore `ordId`.
 * That is a rewrite of a working editor's core, not the minimal, reversible
 * adoption this change is scoped to, and it is not attempted here.
