/**
 * peeringAvailability.js — capability probe for the Vulos peering fabric
 * (`/api/peering/*`).
 *
 * The STANDALONE Office binary (see main.go) never mounts `/api/peering/ice`
 * or `/api/peering/stream` — that fabric is provided by a Vulos OS / Vulos
 * Relay host in front of Office (see docs/COLLABORATION.md §4, docs/
 * ADMIN-GUIDE.md "Peering fabric"). Unfortunately the relay-client's
 * FabricClient.join() resolves successfully even when the signaling
 * WebSocket never connects: it fire-and-forgets the WS connect (retrying with
 * backoff in the background) and its ICE fetch silently falls back to an
 * empty server list on a 404. Left unchecked, that means `configured`/
 * `joined` flip true and status pills like Sheets/Slides' ConnectionPill
 * settle on a calm "Live" — a false positive — even though no peer can ever
 * actually reach this session, and "Collaborate via link" invites mint links
 * that will never connect anyone.
 *
 * This module gives callers an honest, fast, non-throwing answer BEFORE they
 * commit to a fabric session, so the UI can say "unavailable" instead of
 * silently pretending to be live. See useCollabFabric.js and useP2PCollab.js.
 *
 * The result is cached per iceUrl for the lifetime of the page: whether this
 * origin serves the peering fabric is a deploy-time fact that cannot change
 * mid-session, so there is no reason to re-probe on every editor mount.
