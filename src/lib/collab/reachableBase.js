/**
 * reachableBase.js — deploy-time facts from GET /api/reachability: Office's
 * EXTERNALLY-REACHABLE base URL, and (new) the configured rendezvous URL for
 * OS-free P2P collaboration.
 *
 * ── Reachable base (NAT-reachability client wiring, two-class app model) ────
 *
 * P2P collab rendezvous is same-origin: a peer joins by opening an invite link
 * that points back at the host box's Office. When the OWNER loaded Office over a
 * LAN-only / private address (e.g. http://192.168.1.20:8080 or a `.local` host)
 * and then invites an EXTERNAL peer, an invite link built from
 * `window.location.origin` would embed that unreachable private address — the
 * external peer can never connect.
 *
 * The box's operator surfaces the real public origin (a public domain, or a
 * vulos-relay tunnel URL when the box is behind NAT/CGNAT) via the backend env
 * VULOS_OFFICE_PUBLIC_URL, exposed at the unauthenticated `GET /api/reachability`
 * endpoint (see backend/handlers/system.go).
 *
 * When VULOS_OFFICE_PUBLIC_URL is unset (a directly-reachable standalone box, or
 * the cloud deployment where the origin IS public) the resolved base is empty
 * and callers fall back to `window.location.origin` — byte-identical to today.
 *
 * ── Rendezvous URL (standalone P2P with no Vulos OS / host box) ─────────────
 *
 * The SAME endpoint also surfaces `rendezvous_url` (config.yaml
 * `collab.rendezvous_url` / VULOS_RENDEZVOUS_URL — see backend/config/config.go):
 * the base URL of any vulos-relayd's OPEN rendezvous surface (announce/resolve/
 * signal/mailbox + ICE) that the BROWSER can talk to DIRECTLY, with no host-box
 * `/api/peering/*` in the loop at all. When set, a standalone Ofisi binary
 * (which mounts no `/api/peering/*`, see main.go) can still get real
 * peer-to-peer collaboration — see transportSelection.js for how this and
 * host-box peering combine, and docs/COLLABORATION.md §3 for the full picture.
 * Empty when unset, same honesty contract as public_base_url: callers must
 * treat "" as "not configured", never guess a default.
 *
 * Both facts come from ONE fetch (single-flight, cached for the page lifetime —
 * these are deploy-time facts, not per-session ones).
