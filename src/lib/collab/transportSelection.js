/**
 * transportSelection.js — the three-way collaboration transport decision.
 *
 * Every FabricClient construction site in Ofisi (useCollabFabric.js for
 * presence/Sheets/Slides doc-sync, useP2PCollab.js for Docs/Whiteboard invite
 * links) needs the same answer to "how do we reach a peer?", in the same
 * priority order:
 *
 *   1. HOST_PEERING  — this server itself mounts `/api/peering/*` (a Vulos OS
 *      or Vulos Relay host is in front of Ofisi). Preferred when present:
 *      unchanged from Ofisi's original behaviour, and it is the one transport
 *      that can carry an authToken tied to an account session.
 *   2. RENDEZVOUS    — no host-box peering, but this deployment has a
 *      configured rendezvous URL (config.yaml `collab.rendezvous_url` /
 *      VULOS_RENDEZVOUS_URL, see backend/config/config.go): any self-hosted
 *      `vulos-relayd`'s open announce/resolve/signal/mailbox + ICE surface —
 *      no Vulos OS, no account. THE PAYOFF: this is what makes standalone
 *      Ofisi capable of real P2P.
 *
 *      The browser calls that relayd's origin DIRECTLY, cross-origin. Ofisi's
 *      server is not in the discovery path at all, so it never sees even the
 *      (already content-blind) rendezvous envelopes. This relies on relayd's
 *      rendezvous role serving CORS, which e2e-p2p/ asserts against a real
 *      relayd and a real browser. Ofisi previously pass-through-proxied the
 *      protocol on its own origin because relayd sent no CORS headers and 405'd
 *      the preflight; that proxy is gone. See docs/COLLABORATION.md §3.
 *   3. LOCAL_ONLY    — neither is available. The editor keeps working; it
 *      just never opens a transport. Honest "Offline" / disabled affordances,
 *      never a false "Live".
 *
 * Centralising the decision here (rather than duplicating the probe-then-branch
 * logic in every hook) is what keeps the three call sites in agreement and
 * keeps the logic unit-testable without a DOM or a real network.
 *
 * See docs/COLLABORATION.md §3 for the user-facing explanation of all three.
