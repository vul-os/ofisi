/**
 * Playwright config — REAL P2P integration suite (e2e-p2p/).
 *
 * Deliberately separate from playwright.config.js. That suite is hermetic and
 * fast: a `vite preview` build with every /api call mocked in-browser. This one
 * is the opposite — it builds and runs real binaries (a `vulos-relayd` from the
 * sibling vulos-relay checkout plus two standalone `vulos-office` servers) and
 * negotiates real WebRTC between two browser contexts. It is slower and depends
 * on a Go toolchain and that sibling checkout, so it must never be able to
 * destabilise the fast suite. Run it with `npm run test:e2e:p2p`.
 *
 * There is no `webServer` here: the suite boots its own processes (e2e-p2p/stack.mjs)
 * because it needs several of them, on ports it chooses, with per-instance config.
